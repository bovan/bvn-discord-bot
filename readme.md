some discord bot
===

Rewriting of some code I had in various experimental files.

features:
- connects to discord so I have access to commands everywhere using mobile app
- lets me check my Philips Hue lights

todo:
- change light color/luminosity through the bot
- rewrite my RSS scripts to a class for getting matches from HLTV
- rewrite my hlds rcon checker to class for probing my csgo servers
- create a seen class for using !seen to see when the user last was seen online if offline
- add a !remindMe functionality that can remind in a channel or in a private message
